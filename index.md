### CPSC 120 

* Lab 5

    One of my favorite labs was Lab 5, part 3. It was interesting to see how the program would run a game of Blackjack. It was fun creating the different arguments and statements that would help the program run correctly. 

* Lab 6 

    My second favorite lab was Lab 6, part 1. It was interesting to see how a program will run a loop without it becoming an infinite loop or crashing. I thought it would be more complicated than it was and was satisfying once it works. 

* Lab 7

    Another one of my favorite labs was Lab 7, part 2. I have always enjoyed card games, so it was exciting to expand this program with functions. The functions were a little difficult to write, but it felt rewarding when they worked.
